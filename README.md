# Interlibrary-Loan-Database
A database design for a hypothetical interlibrary loan system, including a relational database schema, standard SQL queries, an API implementing those queries, 
and a program which generates large test datasets. Code was written in Java for MariaDB.

"Interlibrary Loan Database Report.pdf" is a final report detailing the database design, and in particular its entity-relationship model and relational database schema.

"genres.txt," "names.txt," "streetnames.txt," and "words.txt" are lists of arbitrary phrases used by "DataInserter.java" to generate entries in a test database.
"DataInserter.java" generates a large test database.
"InterLibraryLoanAPI.java" is an API for the interlibrary loan database. It can be used to run a selection of standard SQL queries.
"APITest.java" is a test program for the Interlibrary Loan Database API.
